# Functional Differential Geometry

This is me playing around with [Functional Differential Geometry](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/functional-differential-geometry), and the associated `scmutils` scheme library for symbolic mathematics.

Functional Differential Geometry is from the authors of the famed [Structure and Interpretations of Computer
Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html), and is implemented in Scheme.

Initially I was going to do this entire thing in julia, but the `scmutils` library is 65,000 lines of code. That might be a little ambitious for a side project.

### Goals
- get better at differential geometry
- read and learn more functional wizardry
- write more macros
- hopefully apply this to some of the information geometry ideas floating around.
